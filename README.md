## Mastering Mouse Colony Genetics: Preventing Inbreeding with Pedigrees and R

Join us in this detailed tutorial as we delve into the science of maintaining a healthy mouse colony. Learn how to visualize pedigrees, calculate inbreeding coefficients, and predict future inbreeding scores using the pedtools package and the pedsuite collection in R. This video will guide you step-by-step through the process of uploading animal data, creating pedigrees, and making informed decisions about potential matings to avoid the pitfalls of inbreeding. Perfect for researchers and lab technicians managing genetic studies in mice, this tutorial ensures you have the tools to maintain genetic diversity and robustness in your colony.
